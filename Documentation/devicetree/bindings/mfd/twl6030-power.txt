Texas Instruments TWL family (twl6030) reset and power management module

For now, the binding only supports the complete shutdown of the system after
poweroff.

Required properties:
- compatible : must be
	"ti,twl6030-power"

Optional properties:

- ti,system-power-controller: This indicates that TWL6030 is the
  power supply master of the system. With this flag, the chip will
  initiate an ACTIVE-to-OFF or SLEEP-to-OFF transition when the
  system poweroffs.

Example:
&i2c1 {
	clock-frequency = <2600000>;

	twl: twl@48 {
		reg = <0x48>;
		interrupts = <7>; /* SYS_NIRQ cascaded to intc */
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;

		twl_power: power {
			compatible = "ti,twl6030-power";
			ti,system-power-controller;
		};
	};
};
